            <p>
              Web designing is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and implementing the plan for designing a website in a way that is functional and offers a good user experience. User experience is central to the web designing process. Websites have an array of elements presented in ways that make them easy to navigate.
               Web designing essentially involves working on every attribute of the website that people interact with, so that the website is simple and efficient, allows users to quickly find the information they need, and looks visually pleasing. All these factors, when combined, decide how well the website is designed.

            <p> A full-stack developer needs to possess some basic soft skills as well. 
                    Creativity:
                 The developer must understand the project's objectives and create a product that engages the target audience. 
                Strategic planning: Planning is a critical phase in any development life-cycle. The developer should possess the aptitude to plan the design, development, and implementation phases strategically. This helps streamline the process.
                Analytical skills:
                 As the name suggests, these skills help analyze information accurately and make logical, data-driven decisions that help in maximizing efficiency. Now, these are skills that one develops when they're exposed to it. But a good sense of understanding is required. 
                Problem-solving skills are again crucial to predict any errors and develop a bug-free application. From a business perspective, problem-solving skills play a significant role in ensuring the smooth conduction of tasks. 
                Time management skills: The developer must meet the deadlines while ensuring proper execution of his tasks.</p>
